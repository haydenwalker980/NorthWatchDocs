# Cloudflare Errors
We use CloudFlare to stay online, and occasionally you might see errors from them.  Here is an explination of what they mean on NorthWatch.

## Error 1015 - You are being rate limited
This happens if you are refreshing the page too fast, or are switching beteen many pages.  To prevent spam, we only allow a certain number of page requests per time period, then you will get the error for the one minute cooldown.

## Error 1020 - Access denied
This happens if you are accessing a restricted page (registration, scambaiter login, etc.), and you have been detected to be a scammer by our automatic detection systems.  We use these systems to prevent scammers from creating and using NorthWatch.  If you are getting this error and you are a ligitimate user, try accessing NorthWatch on a diffrent device or browser, and try incognito/private mode.

## One more step - Security Checks
These are very common, and will happen if we detect that you are using a VPN, or are exhibiting any high-risk behavior.  These don't effect your account or NorthWatch in any way other than requiring a little bit of extra verification.
