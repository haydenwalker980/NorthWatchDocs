## - Bank Accounts
You can edit any of your fake Bank Account's titles and their balance just by clicking on "Edit".

## - IP/Logins
This page shows the recent activity on your account. It shows exactly what parts of the site you visited, what time, the IP of the machine you have visited them from and the browser you used.
There is also an "IP Lookup" at the last column of every row. Clicking it will open a lookup of that IP in a new tab on the website [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)

Note: *NorthWatch is not in any way assosiated with [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/).*
